# Data projects
Hi! I'm Mauro Gación and this are my data projects. I will list all of them here so you can easily find them.

# Twitch Streaming
I started this project because my brother is a streamer with the username TokaSenseiGG.
I learned the power of data and I want to use it to help him make data-driven decisions.

### Data Gathering
In order to help him I needed data first. Learning about Twitch API, I started to desing a Python script that gathers data from twitch using its endpoints. 

Here is the link: [Django Web App](https://github.com/MGKuro/Django_Web)

### Dashboards
Now, we have a Power BI dashboard to measure performance and act according to it. We can filter by date and hour. For this filters, some Power BI formulas has to be made and new fields has to be created. 

We can see how many viewers where there, if the stream was too short and we ended it when there where the most viewers or if it was too long and viewers (and also the streamer) get tired. We can find the best hour to broadcast. We can know if certain game type generate new followers and subscribers, and so on. We can also analyze this info with other tables from twitch to make some insights. Is time for data-driven decisions.

# Machine Learning with Python
I took a certificated course of Machine Learning with python in the UTN (Universidad tecnológica Nacional). Here, I learned the basics of ML and use it to analize a wine dataset.
You can look at this Jupyter notebook here: [ML Certification](https://github.com/MGKuro/ML-Cap)
