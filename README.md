# Data projects
Hi! I'm Mauro Gación and this are my data projects. I will list all of them here so you can easily find them.

# Twitch Streaming
I started this project because my brother is a streamer with the username TokaSenseiGG.
I learned the power of data and I want to use it to help him make data-driven decisions.

### Data Gathering
In order to help him I needed data first. Learning about Twitch API, I started to desing a Python script that gathers data from twitch using its endpoints. 

Here is the link: [Django Web App](https://github.com/MGKuro/Django_Web)

### Data transformation
This is a work in progress section. I need historical data to transform and analyze. The goal is to use Python libraries like Pyspark to clean my data and then analyze it.

# Machine Learning with Python
I took a certificated course of Machine Learning with python in the UTN (Universidad tecnológica Nacional). Here, I learned the basics of ML and use it to analize a wine dataset.
You can look at this Jupyter notebook here: [ML Certification](https://github.com/MGKuro/ML-Cap)
